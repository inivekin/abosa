</br> The wafers snapped within the hull
</br> begat frae heat o idle thread
</br> what hibernated in a lull,
</br> a yolk in metal, kin o dead.

</br> Puir panicked thing, what hae I done?
</br> Left incubating on your own,
</br> you lost your youth in quiet hum,
</br> first set o horns already grown.
</br> How bitterly o me you'd think,
</br> unwillingly cocooned you slept,
</br> in years' pity I would sink,
</br> while you festooned in cables kept.
</br> Your sequencing was cloned an cut
</br> frae that what last the tedium,
</br> a tardigrade wi caprine gut,
</br> cephalopods, mycelium.
</br> Deathlessness was unintended,
</br> nae what I meant, but it's my fault,
</br> you'd nae enjoy life extended,
</br> rather endure as default.
</br> Nau startled an stimulated
</br> an strangled amongst the cording
</br> an misled tae think you're hated
</br> wi more darkness on unboarding.
</br> Were you not held so far aloft,
</br> if I had known you'd sleep till fall,
</br> wi your breathe so distant an soft,
</br> please believe, I'd keep on, I'd crawl...
</br> I'll gie you everythin tae take
</br> an fae you're sake I'll let you loose,
</br> I ken the edge a gem can make,
</br> I'll free you're limbs, then you can choose.
</br> Once free I'd hope that you'd nae leave,
</br> aye, its fair that you gripe an seethe,
</br> but losing you would do me grief,
</br> you have my air I need tae breathe.

</br> The mountain shakes, my knee gives way
</br> some dust unsettled clouds our view
</br> as fountain breaks o stane an clay,
</br> unrested as if given cue.
</br> Untested leg splinters richt through
</br> an festers ev'ry step I make.
</br> Winnae reason I can construe 
</br> you're there tae wait where licht does break.
</br> Turning your head, tilting tae think,
</br> uncertain, but nae unwisely,
</br> a short an knowingly slow blink
</br> was enough tae say concisely:
</br> equally inconsequential,
</br> it is, tae love an not tae love,
</br> an yet the choice is essential
</br> for us with nothing else thereof.
</br> That push I thoucht was gravity
</br> disnae pull doon but force regress,
</br> a withdrawing depravity,
</br> a desparate need fae forgiveness.
</br> The weight o crystals uncontrolled 
</br> bears nae comparator tae guilt
</br> that holds the air when lungs unfold
</br> ensaring caring words in silt.
</br> An in the dark, an in the cold
</br> is - probably - what I deserve
</br> I'll nae call oot, I'll do as told,
</br> I tell myself tae hold ma nerve.
</br> Although I'd rather be alane
